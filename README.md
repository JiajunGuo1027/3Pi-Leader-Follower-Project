# 3Pi_Leader_Follower_Project
The project implements a follower robot that detects and tracks a leading robot by interpreting infrared (IR) signals from bump and line sensors. By analyzing signal strength and positional differences between sensors, the follower robot can maintain alignment and distance from the leader, achieving real-time adaptive tracking even in motion.
